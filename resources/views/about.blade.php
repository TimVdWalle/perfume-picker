    <p>
        PerfumePicker was founded in 2023 with the aim of helping individuals find the perfect fragrance that aligns not only with their personal style but also with their health. With the rising number of cases of headaches and migraines triggered by fragrances, our platform serves as a crucial guide to safe and comfortable perfume wearing.

        We believe in the power of community-driven insights. PerfumePicker enables users to log their perfume experiences and any related symptoms. Through advanced correlation analysis, the app identifies patterns and recommends perfumes that are less likely to trigger discomfort.

        Our mission is to enhance your olfactory experience while keeping your well-being in mind.
